# Database-Project

SQL project with Java implementation for both connection to the Database and the graphical interface.

Designed and created a database which had 5 tables, two of them having m-m connections (this added 2 additional auxiliary tables). I made a graphical interface in Java, using Java Fx and JDBC, in which i had:
- 6 easy interrogations (at least one join with 2 different tables)
- 4 a bit more difficult (SELECT within SELECT)
- 2 different delete/update/insert options, in two different tables
The interrogations had to have variable inputs (i got them through TextFields), and the DDL part I ussualy made 3 fields, with name/surname/cnp to identify uniquely the entrance the user wanted to delete or update.
Also, the app had a login screen which closed after a successful login.
